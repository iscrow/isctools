# A script to capture a screen region, run OCR on it,
# and copy the resulting text to the clipboard.
#

# -- SETUP --
# Define the temporary file path for the screenshot.
# Using mktemp ensures we create a unique, temporary file securely.
TMP_FILE=$(mktemp --suffix=.png)

# -- CAPTURE --
# Use KDE's spectacle to capture a rectangular region (-r) in the background (-b)
# without launching the GUI (-n), and save it to our temporary file (-o).
spectacle -b -n -r -o "$TMP_FILE"

# -- VALIDATE --
# Check if the screenshot file was actually created.
# The user might press 'Esc' to cancel the screenshot.
# The -s flag checks if the file exists and has a size greater than zero.
if [ ! -s "$TMP_FILE" ]; then
    # If the file is empty or doesn't exist, notify and exit.
    notify-send "OCR Canceled" "No screenshot was taken."
    exit 1
fi

# -- PROCESS --
# Perform OCR on the captured image.
# 'tesseract "$TMP_FILE" stdout' runs OCR and prints the text to standard output.
# That output is then piped '|' to xclip.
# 'xclip -selection clipboard' takes the input and puts it on the system clipboard.
tesseract "$TMP_FILE" stdout | xclip -selection clipboard

# -- NOTIFY & CLEAN UP --
# Send a desktop notification to confirm the text has been copied.
notify-send "OCR Successful" "Text has been copied to the clipboard."

# Remove the temporary screenshot file.
rm "$TMP_FILE"
